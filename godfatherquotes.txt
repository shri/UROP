"Don Corleone:
We have known each other many years, but this is the first time you've come to me for counsel or for help. I can't remember the last time you invited me to your house for a cup of coffee, even though my wife is godmother to your only child. But let's be frank here. You never wanted my friendship. And you feared to be in my debt.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"Bonasera:
I didn't want to get into trouble.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0181128/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"Don Corleone:
I understand. You found paradise in America. You had a good trade, you made a good living. The police protected you and there were courts of law. So you didn't need a friend like me. Now you come and say 'Don Corleone, give me justice.' But you don't ask with respect. You don't offer friendship. You don't even think to call me 'Godfather.' You come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder - for money.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"Bonasera:
I ask you for justice.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0181128/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"Don Corleone:
That is not justice. Your daughter is alive.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"Bonasera:
Let them suffer then as she suffers.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0181128/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"[the Don is silent]"
"Bonasera:
How much shall I pay you?","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0181128/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"[the Don turns away dismissively, but Bonasera stays on]"
"Don Corleone:
Bonasera, Bonasera, what have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you'd come to me in friendship, this scum who ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if by some chance an honest man like yourself made enemies they would become my enemies. And then, they would fear you.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"Bonasera:
Be my friend... Godfather.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0181128/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"[the Don at first shrugs, but upon hearing the title he lifts his hand, and a humbled Bonasera kisses the ring on it]"
"Don Corleone:
Good.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"[He places his hand around Bonasera in a paternal gesture]"
"Don Corleone:
Some day, and that day may never come, I will call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day, consider this justice a gift on my daughter's wedding day.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"[a gratified Bonasera offers his thanks and leaves]"
"Don Corleone:
[to Hagen]
Give this job to Clemenza. I want reliable people, people who aren't going to be carried away. I mean, we're not murderers, in spite of what this undertaker thinks...","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"

Tell me, Michael. Please.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000473/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"Michael:
Well, when Johnny was first starting out, he was signed to a personal services contract with this big-band leader. And as his career got better and better, he wanted to get out of it. But the band leader wouldn't let him. Now, Johnny is my father's godson. So my father went to see this bandleader and offered him $10,000 to let Johnny go, but the bandleader said no. So the next day, my father went back, only this time with Luca Brasi. Within an hour, he had a signed release for a certified check of $1000.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000199/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"

"Johnny Fontane:
[discussing his problems]
I don't know what to do, Godfather. My voice is weak, it's weak. Anyway, if I had this part in the picture, it puts me right back on top, you know. But this... this man out there. He won't give it to me, the head of the studio.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0553887/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"

"[Meanwhile, Hagen finds Sonny and summons him]"
"Johnny Fontane:
A month ago he bought the rights to this book, a best seller. The main character is a guy just like me. I wouldn't even have to act, just be myself. Oh, Godfather, I don't know what to do, I don't know what to do...","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0553887/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"

"[first lines]"
"Bonasera:
I believe in America. America has made my fortune. And I raised my daughter in the American fashion. I gave her freedom but I taught her never to dishonor her family. She found a 'boy friend,' not an Italian. She went to the movies with him. She stayed out late. I didn't protest. Two months ago he took her for a drive, with another boy friend. They made her drink whiskey and then they tried to take advantage of her. She resisted. She kept her honor. So they beat her. Like an animal. When I went to the hospital her nose was broken. Her jaw was shattered, held together by wire. She couldn't even weep because of the pain. But I wept. Why did I weep? She was the light of my life. A beautiful girl. Now she will never be beautiful again.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0181128/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"[He breaks down at this point, and the Don gestures to his son to get him a drink]"
"Bonasera:
Sorry...","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0181128/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"[He regains his composure and carries on]"
"Bonasera:
I went to the police, like a good American. These two boys were brought to trial. The judge sentenced them to three years in prison, and suspended the sentence. Suspended sentence! They went free that very day! I stood in the courtroom like a fool, and those two bastards, they smiled at me. Then I said to my wife, 'For justice, we must go to Don Corleone.'","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0181128/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"Don Corleone:
Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first?","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"Bonasera:
What do you want of me? Tell me anything. But do what I beg you to do.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0181128/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"Don Corleone:
What is that?","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"

"Sollozzo:
Bene, Don Corleone. I need a man who has powerful friends. I need a million dollars in cash. I need, Don Corleone, all of those politicians that you carry around in your pocket, like so many nickels and dimes.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0504803/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"Don Corleone:
What is the interest for my family?","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"Sollozzo:
Thirty percent. In the first year your end should be three, four million dollars. And then it would go up.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0504803/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"Don Corleone:
And what is the interest for the Tattalgia family?","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"

[smiles at Tom]
My compliments.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0504803/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"

I'll take care of the Tattaglias, out of my share.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0504803/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"

So, I am to receive thirty percent for finance, for legal protection and political influence. Is that what you're telling me?","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"Sollozzo:
That's right.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0504803/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"

"Don Corleone:
I said that I would see you because I had heard that you were a serious man, to be treated with respect. But I must say no to you and let me give you my reasons. It's true I have a lot of friends in politics, but they wouldn't be so friendly if they knew my business was drugs instead of gambling which they consider a harmless vice. But drugs, that's a dirty business.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"Sollozzo:
No, Don Corleone...","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0504803/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"

It makes no difference, it don't make any difference to me what a man does for a living, you understand. But your business is a little dangerous.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"

Whoa, now, you're telling me that the Tattaglias guarantee our investment without...?","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001001/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"

Wait a minute.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"[the Don gives his son a cold stare, freezing Santino into silence. The others fidget with embarrassment at this outbreak, but Sollozzo looks slyly satisfied... ]"
"Don Corleone:
[dismissive]
I have a sentimental weakness for my children and I spoil them, as you can see. They talk when they should listen. Anyway, Signor Sollozzo, my no to you is final. I want to congratulate you on your new business and I'm sure you'll do very well and good luck to you. Especially since your interests don't conflict with mine. Thank you.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"

What's the matter with you? I think your brain is going soft with all that comedy you are playing with that young girl. Never tell anyone outside the Family what you are thinking again. Go on.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"

"Jack Woltz:
You don't understand. Johnny Fontane never gets that movie. That part is perfect for him. It'll make him a big star. I'm gonna run him out of the movies. And let me tell you why. Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz International's most valuable proteges. For three years we had her under contract, singing lessons, dancing lessons, acting lessons. I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars. I was gonna make her a big star. And let me be even more frank, just to show you that I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it's not all dollars and cents. She was beautiful! She was young, she was innocent. She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had 'em all over the world. And then Johnny Fontaine comes along with his olive oil voice and guinea charm and she runs off. She threw it all away just to make me look ridiculous. And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous. Now you get the hell out of here! And if that goomba tries any rough stuff, you tell him I ain't no bandleader. Yeah, I heard that story.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0549134/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"

He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll and for big money. Now, McClusky has agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard. Now what you have to understand, Sonny, is that while Sollozzo's being guarded like this he is invulnerable. Nobody has ever gunned down a New York police captain before. It would be disasterous. All the other five families would turn against you. The Corleone Family would be outcast. Even the old man's political protection would run for cover.

Now we insist that it be held in a public place, a bar or a restaurant where there'll be other people there so I'll feel safe. They're going to search me when I first meet them, right?

"Tom Hagen:
Sollozo is known as the Turk. He's supposed to be very good with a knife. But only in matters of business, or of some sort of reasonable complaint. His business is narcotics. He has the fields in Turkey, where they grow the poppy. In Sicily he has the plant to process it into heroin. He needs cash and he needs protection from the police for which he gives a piece of the action, I couldn't find out how much. The Tattaglia Family is behind him here in New York so they have to be in it for something.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000380/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"

Tom?","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000008/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"
"Tom Hagen:
Well, I say yes. There is more money potential in narcotics than anything else we're looking at now. If we don't get into it, somebody else will, maybe one of the Five Families, maybe all of them. And with the money they earn they'll be able to buy more police and political power. Then they come after us. Right now we have the unions and we have the gambling and those are the best things to have. But narcotics is a thing of the future. If we don't get a piece of that action we risk everything we have. Not now, but ten years from now.","http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000380/?ref_=tt_trv_qu"

Times have changed. It's not like the Old Days, when we can do anything we want. A refusal is not the act of a friend.
